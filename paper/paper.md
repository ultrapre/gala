# Summary

# Statement of Need

While Stellarium provides an expansive and curated catalog of built-in nebula and DSO textures, it lacks native support for user-defined, dynamically inserted visual assets. The manual process of aligning astrophotographs or drawings to celestial coordinates is technically demanding and error-prone, with limited user interface support. As a result, even experienced users often refrain from customizing their Stellarium installations.

This work presents NebulaTextures, a plugin that addresses this gap by offering an intuitive workflow for image import, automatic astrometric registration, and seamless integration into Stellariumâ€™s rendering engine. It empowers users to easily enhance their Stellarium experience with their own visual contributions.

# Astronomical Context

# System Design

NebulaTextures integrates with Stellarium using its established plugin infrastructure. The plugin's design is modular, with key components handling specific tasks:

# Astrometric Algorithms


# Applications


# Acknowledgements

We thank the Stellarium team for their extensible plugin framework and their thoughtful guidance provided in the pull request, and the Astrometry.net project for their essential plate-solving service.
